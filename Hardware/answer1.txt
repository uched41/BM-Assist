Hello

1) Display
	- I will send you the datasheet for the display to that you can get all the dimension ino you need.
	- The display has no holes for fastening, I thinking glueing the the option we have, but you can select any method that you prefer.
	- The with of the flexible cable is about 25 mm. 

2) Light emitting body/ring
	- I am not aware of this. I dont think we are going to implement this. We are powering the device from a battery, so we need to minimize power consumption as much as possible.
	
3) Exact dimension of PCB
	- Thickness of pcb is 1.6 mm
